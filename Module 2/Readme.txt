Styling Approach
The styling approach aims to create an old parchment look while ensuring high legibility:

Use of a parchment-like background color and texture.
Serif fonts for an old-fashioned feel (Georgia for body text, Cinzel for headers).
Dark text on light background for optimal readability.
Decorative first letter for each section.
Soft, rounded backgrounds for individual sections to improve visual separation.

(Note: Screenshots of validations should be included with the submission)
